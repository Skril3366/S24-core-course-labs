As you can see, we have two pods running the same application, but each of them
uses a different volume, this is why the number of visits is different.
```bash
 ❯ kubectl exec app-python-0 -- cat ./data/visits
2
 ❯ kubectl exec app-python-1 -- cat ./data/visits
10
```

## Task 2.2

As our application does not depend on any external services or its own replicas.
The only external dependence is a file with visit counter which is not shared
among replicas. Thus, it doesn't need any ordering guarantees

For allowing launch or termination of pods in parallel I've added `podManagementPolicy: Parallel`
